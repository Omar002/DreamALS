1) Prepare the data

	This is the structure of directory: 
	data should be put in a directory named "data", which located at the same 
	directory 	as preprocessor.R, so before processing ALS data, please create 
	a directory named "data" and fill the files required.


2) Prepare the environment

	Environment:
		* R version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18) -- "World-Famous Astronaut" 
		* python 2.7.9
		* predictor.py can run on the IBM machine (python 2.7.10)

	Serveral libraries have been used by preprocessor.R, so install them first:
		* python libraries:
			- pandas
			- numpy

		* R librarys:
			- foreach
			- doParallel
			- plyr

	R packages can be installed through commands below:

		$ R

		> install.packages("foreach")
		> install.packages("doParallel")
		> install.packages("plyr")


3) Run the program

	$ Rscript preprocessor.R

	By enter the command above, the script would prepare data for our predictor
	model.The output of this r script would be 3 csv files: subjects to 
	time-independent features and subjects to time-dependent features ( maximum
	value and minimum value of each feature ).

	$ sh selector.sh $1 $2
	$ sh predictor.sh $1 $2

	The variables ( $1 and $2 ) are input and output of each shell script
	respectively.Both $1 of the commands are data of a single subject.
	For example:
		$ sh selector.sh 329.txt 329.out1.txt
		$ sh predictor.sh 329.out1.txt 329.out2.txt

4) Postscript

	* What is "information_gain_top6.csv" and what is it for?
		"information_gain_top6.csv" was produced from output of "preprocessor.R"
		by a opensourse software called orange 
		Website: http://orange.biolab.si/
		
		"information_gain_top6.csv" is the training data set for our predicting
		model.

	* Execution time
		On a 64-core machine, preprocessor.R takes approximately 3.5 hours.
